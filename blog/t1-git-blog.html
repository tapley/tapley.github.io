        Our goal for this week was to learn how to use Git, and while I didn't have any experience using the program, I was struck by how it's core feature, version control, reminded me of Google Docs.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the unfamiliar, git is a program that allows users to save checkpoints (known as commits) of their code so that users can return to previous versions if they need to backtrack. It also allows the branching and merging of different versions of code, so that an individual can experiment with the code without risking the master copy (knwon as master branch). Tracking commits are extremely important for git users. Each commit will containg a brief description of the changes along with detailed changes inside the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google Docs doesn't offer a replacement for merging, but it does offer automatic commits and branching. When Google Docs was first released, the collaborative potential was huge, as people could access a single document on different computers, easily copy off their own version, and return to previous versions of the document at any time. Comparatively, Microsoft Word had no version control; it simply overwrote the previous file. There were several times in college when I was able to backtrack on an editing mistake thanks to Google Doc's feature, and it now appears obvious that Google applied Git's logic to Microsoft Word.

        If the Google Docs interface resembled git, Google Drive was simply Github, allowing users to copy, share, and collaborate on documents, each of which came with their own history of changes. Google Docs is now bundled with Google Drive, so it's worth noting that while Git and Github have a comparable relationship, Git is a separate entity that does not require Github's sharing/cloud features.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll end with the frustrating acknowledgement that this is an imperfect comparison between two programs whose features differ greatly, but once this comparison clicked for me, I found that Git and Github started making sense, and from there I could note the obvious difference between Git/Github and Google Docs/Drive. Hopefully this can help anyone still struggling with the concept!
