      Let's suppose we're given a large group of people, each with a student ID and a name. How could we reasonably group these people into smaller study groups? The enumerable group_by offers a valuable solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      group_by runs a block of code on each item in a collection and returns a hash in which items that produced the same block result are grouped together. The result from the block is stored in the hash's key and the items are stored in an array of values. The following code from <a href= "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-group_by">Ruby-Docs does a good job of displaying this</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      (1..6).group_by { |i| i%3 }</br></br>#=> {0=>[3, 6], 1=>[1, 4], 2=>[2, 5]}
    </p>
    <p>
      To group the students, one would first have to determine the number of study groups desired. Students could then be assigned an ID from 1 to 4. In order to quickly order the larger group of students, one would simply have to use the following implementation of group_by:
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      list_names_IDs.group_by {|i| i.ID}
    </p>
    <p>
      The result would be a hash with students grouped by their IDs. As we progress with Ruby and begin assinging properties to objects, we may find that challenges such as this week's Challenge 5 become far easier, thanks to enumerables such as group_by.
