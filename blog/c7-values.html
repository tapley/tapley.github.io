      Prompt: When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind [see list on Github]?
    </p>
    <p>
      Coolness under fire, Cooperation, Helping others, Responsibility
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      In general, I try to live up to these values:,</br>
      Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree

      5

      Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.

      My dad was always very good with being cool under fire, and I like to think I got a bit of his talent. I always had a pretty loose leash as a child — my dad would only step in at the last possible moment, right when I was way in over my head. This freedom let me explore a lot, but there were definitely some times where he had to bail me out, and if he hadn't been cool under fire, I probably would've panicked and been unable to follow his direction on how to fix things. </br>A good example would be when he let me drive our boat around at age 5. I got to run the boat going through a bay, but when we got near a harbor, I nearly put our boats on the rocks. I always knew whenever I had messed up because dad's instructions would go from casual to very, very clear. In this case, it was no longer "Try taking the boat back that way;" it was "Ok Tapley, you need to put the boat all the way in reverse right now. Now turn the handle to the left two times and then straighten it out." There have been some times where I've needed to give clear instructions under pressure, and I think I handled it decently.

      What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?
    </p>

      The last time I really helped out a friend was with some school work on which he was panicking. I came over, helped him calm down, and then broke up his tasks into some smaller ones. It seemed to help — if anything, calming him down allowed him to think more clearly and to be productive again.

      How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it? Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
    </p>
    <p>
      I like my values, though I'm not sure they'll have much effect on stereotype threat. I think these are helpful to consider, but I'm probably just going to go on runs if I feel down at DBC.
