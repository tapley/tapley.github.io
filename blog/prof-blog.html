      I spent some time making a clearer update timeframe. I actually like the design of my webpage now (something I could not have said after my first attempt). The color scheme is working well, and I like the simplified layout of the blog posts. I spoke with a few people about my layout, and they seemed to agree, which was obviously encouraging.

      The bigger questions are how I should go about updating the indeces of blogs/projects and the about page. Unfortunately I didn't have time to implement these changes due to the time limit I had assigned for this challenge, but I think it's worth having a clear plan, so I'm posting it below.

      The "About Me" section has been a challenge since I'm not sure how detailed I'd like to be on the internet. I don't see much advantage in putting personal information online, but I can also see how some descriptions may be useful. Teresa had a good method for her website in which she simply posted the feedback she had received during Phase 0. I thought this was really interesting, and I'm tempted to add it later on as a sub-page of the About Me page. For now, I'd like the About Me section to simply link to my Github, LinkedIn, and maybe Facebook.

      The projects index will need to be filled in as I actually build things that can be displayed in a browser. I still think the idea setup will be to have a quick summary of the project, along with links to the project itself as well as the source code on github. I'd like to keep each project profile simple, drawing on the layout I used for my DBC blogs.

      The blogs index will need a few tweaks in the coming weeks. Blog titles will need to be accompanied by a post, and the layout between each blog profile will need to be changed. I like the 900 width, top-bottom-bordered layout I have on my blogs now, so I'll likely draw on that.
