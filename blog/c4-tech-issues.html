      We've been asked to write about problems facing the tech industry and to limit our time to an hour. This will be frustratingly inadequate. Sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be obvious by now that tech has a massive diversity problem. Self-reported numbers show little diversity at tech's major corporations, and these companies presumably have better recruiting resources than smaller competitors. Anyone who is neither a white male nor an Asian male may look at the tech landscape and question whether this career path is worth it.

      A convenient response for those hiring is to note the dearth of diversity in engineering departments across national universities, and while this may be true, it overlooks a continually growing list of accounts that suggests Silicon Valley is hostile to the few women and minorities who arrive. Within the last six months, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html">L.A. Times</a>, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-13/code-of-silicon-valley-minority-you-can-t-be-angry-">Bloomberg Business</a>, and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/What-it-s-like-to-be-a-black-female-5938594.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a> have all published valuable insights into tech's prejudices.

      Those of us who are favored by tech's current system should think long and hard about how we want to partake in this industry. At the very least, I would suggest a two-fold approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      1) Look inward: It's safe to say that few in the tech field believe that they are prejudiced. But the use of Implicit Association Tests consistently show that those who believe they are free of prejudices are often mistaken — subconscious biases still remain in many people, even if conscious biases have been rightfully erased. As the subconscious microaggressions of a society aggregate, a prejudiced system grows, and the only way to reasonably change that system is to understand then change the subconscious biases that feed it. <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html">Harvard's pyschology department offers a free IAT test</a>, and I strongly believe it's worth taking, no matter how one sees himself or herself. Without a clear understanding of one's own subconscious biases, even minor self-improvement will be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Look outward: I think the role of an ally is useful here. White and Asian men should not co-opt the efforts of those who are leading the push for diversity in tech, but we certainly need to find a way to contribute. Avoiding the role of a passive bystander is at least a start. White and asian males need to begin standing up with those who are under-represented, rather than expecting those in the minority to stand up by themselves. This shouldn't be a female issue, and this shouldn't be a minority issue. If you see something, say something.

      Like I said, this has been frustratingly inadequate. Sorry.
