      Pairing may be one of my favorite parts about DBC. When I first considered moving into CS/programming, I was concerned by the "lone hacker" image, which seemed like it would be miserable to experience. Luckily, DBC has placed a serious emphasis on pair programming, which involves one person typing while the other dictates what to type. It's reminded me of how writers and editors would collaborate at the YDN. The editor would sit at the computer, suggesting alterations and asking questions about the article. The writer would respond to the editor's sugggestions and dictate the changes to be made. One obvious difference between DBC and the YDN is that pair programming has been entirely remote so far, and I've found this frustrating. Part of this is the minor inconvenience of not being able to point directly to the code while navigating. A more serious issue is harder to describe: pairing via Hangout lacks the connection of working in person. I was suprised this bothered me at all, but I'm realizing that communication feels a lot more natural when you're in the same room as someone, even if you can technically hear and see the person.

      The feedback I've received so far at DBC has been generally positive, but it's worth noting a place for improvement. Two of my earlier pairs mentioned that I was moving pretty fast and that they felt rushed as a result. This isn't meant to be a sort of "I'm really fast at programming" humblebrag â€” it's actually really detrimental to a team, especially in a learning environment such as DBC. In more recent pairs, I've been making sure to slow down and have random "Does all of this make sense?" check-ins with my partner, and it seems that recent pairs have noticed the extra effort. The goal for now is to keep this up and avoid reverting to my default state.
