      One of our recent projects has been to define the scopes of different variables. The following table will hopefully serve as a quick cheatsheet for anyone struggling with the differences. More detailed descriptions and examples can be found at <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_variables.htm">Tutorialspoint</a>.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr class="bold">
        <td>Type</td>
        <td>Format</td>
        <td>Scope</td>
        <td>Usage</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bold">Global</td>
        <td>$global</td>
        <td>Across a program</td>
        <td>Try to avoid global variables; they can make code seem cryptic, since they're only defined in one place.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bold">Class</td>
        <td>@@class</td>
        <td>Across a class</td>
        <td>Class variables allow for the modification of data across an entire class of objects via one assignment, which can save significant time.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bold">Instance</td>
        <td>@instance</td>
        <td>Across an object</td>
        <td>Instance variables are useful if you want to  define information across an object without making it necessarily accessible outside the object.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bold">Local</td>
        <td>local</td>
        <td>Across a block</td>
        <td>Local variables are the most common variable. Their limited scope allows for names to be recycled, which can keep code readable.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="bold">Constant</td>
        <td>CONSTANT</td>
        <td>Across class, module, or program</td>
        <td>Constants are meant to remain the same throughout a program and will produce a warning if the program attempts reassignment.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
