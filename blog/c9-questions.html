      Prompt: Analyze some of the questions you've asked (either in the community, to a a friend, or in Google). Were these good questions? What was good/ not so good about them? How could you make them better so you are more likely to get an answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think one of the biggest mistakes people make when asking questions is trying to look smart. We often associate a person's questions with their intelligence â€” if it's too simple, that person must not be understanding the material at hand. Therefore, we can ask overly-nuanced questions that allow us to appear intelligent while offering little gain in knowledge.
    </p>

      The trick to asking good questions is to ask groups of questions, rather than singular ones. This allows the questioner to start small and then build a progression of logic. This will lead to a better understanding of the larger picture, and it will uncover any flawed assumptions that a more nuanced question would not have uncovered. By the end of a good progression of questions, the chain of logic may even progress to the type of nuanced questions to which most of us default.

      Asking a series of questions therefore allows for two great outcomes: You can uncover a flawed assumption at simpler levels (and look smart!) or you can reach a point of nuanced discussion while understanding the entire subject at hand (and look smart!).
