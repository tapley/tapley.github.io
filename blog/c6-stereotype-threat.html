      This week’s DBC cultural prompt asked us to consider stereotype threat in our own lives and the lives of others.

    <p>
      I'm aware that I can be stereotyped as a WASP, but this is comparatively easy to deal with, so I don’t want to spend much time addressing it. Any stereotype threat I’ve encountered is likely outweighed by stereotype boost, and it’d be ridiculous to put any struggles I’ve had on a similar plan to those who suffer due to far more pernicious stereotypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's worth considering what to do in order to combat stereotype threat, especially from someone who likely benefits from society’s existing stereotypes, but most of the accepted ways to fight stereotype threat seem lacking. The most promising one I came across in my research was defined by UC Berkeley Provost Claude Steele, whose research helped to define stereotype threat. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/?single_page=true">In a 1999 article in the Atlantic</a>, he argues that two steps can be taken to reduce the degree to which someone feels stereotype threat: explicitly state high standards and explicitly state the belief that the person in question can meet these standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this makes sense, but it seems like a short-term solution. A better outcome would attack the existence of any stereotype, but maybe this will naturally happen if Steele’s method allows for more diversity in roles currently affected by stereotype threat. I still don't feel like I have a fully developed view on how to systematically eliminate this phenomenon, but maybe our on-site discussions will yield new ideas.
