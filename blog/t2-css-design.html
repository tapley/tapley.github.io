        The differences between margins, borders, and padding used to always confuse me. Hopefully this can clear a few things up.

        A quick review: Margins, borders, and padding all surround the content in HTML. Margins and padding are simply blank space that separates your border and other objects (in the case of margin) or your border and your content (in the case of padding). A border is a line, series of dashes, pattern, etc that serves as a visual demarcation of the area between your content and the page around it.

        The layout: Check out this great image from W3 schools. I think their use of color for the border is especially helpful.

        Remembering which is which: This is where I always get confused. Borders are pretty easy to remember, since they're the only ones that are colored, but the difference between padding and margins used to trip me up. Here's the foolproof logic that I now use to associate margins and padding:
    </p>
    <p>
        When people are said to be "on the margins," they're living far from what is considered society, just how the margins are far from your content.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we think of "padding," we think of something we wear directly on ourselves, just like how padding is worn directly on your content.
    </p>

      This probably isn't the most profound way to memorize something, but hopefully the visual guide plus a few (weird) memory tricks can help.
