  <p id="title">Fixing mindsets in education</p>

      Part of our preparation for DBC has included learning about the work of Carol Dweck and her colleagues on the differences between fixed and growth mindsets. There’s a decent summary of the concept at Brainpickings (http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/), but I’d also recommend watching Carol Dweck’s talk at the Melbourne Happiness and Its Causes conference (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGvR_0mNpWM).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gweck’s conclusion is that the dichotomy between fixed and growth mindset can permeate into nearly every region in our lives, and she gives countless examples across several different fields: Those who have a fixed mindset are almost always worse-off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the education that many of our brightest minds receive often rewards a fixed mindset, especially in the application process for colleges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The college process is damaging because it discourages risk in students. Rather than trying to grow their minds by trying new things — and thereby risking failing — an aspiring college applicant would be far better served by choosing classes at which he or she can excel by simply proving the knowledge he or she already possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admissions officers may attest that they value risk-taking students, and that may be true. However, the chance of acceptance to a top school continually reaches new lows, and admissions officers themselves admit that their school turns away many qualified applicants. If a qualified applicant can be turned away, why would anyone risk having a low grade on their report card?
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I don’t have a solution to the college process. I went through high school with this fixed mindset, and it worked for me. I’m not sure I would have been accepted had I not strategically chosen classes that, while advanced, clearly played to my strengths, and I still believe it was worth it — I wouldn’t trade my time at Yale for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what should I have done differently?
    </p>
    <p>
      My own issue with a fixed mindset was knowing when to stop. I spent far too much time playing to my own personal strengths in my classes at Yale — I knew I could write well, and I knew I could formulate arguments, so I chose a major that lent itself to essays and debates. I had a great experience with those classes, but I could’ve gained so much more from Yale had I approached my education with a risk-taking growth mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bad news is that I didn’t realize this until graduation. The good news is the experience of DBC embodies the risk, intellectual expansion, and deviance from the norm of a growth mindset, and I don’t think I would have been willing to undertake DBC if I wasn’t already transitioning into a growth mindset. The trick now is to just keep growing.
