      I wasn't particularly suprised by most of what I heard in Shereef's fireside chat, but there are a few points that are worth reiterating here.
    </p>
    <p>
      To quickly summarize: DBC's culture is self-driven and constantly changing, though it does remain attached to certain values such as engineering empathy.This should be expected by most people going into DBC; I think most of the program's materials have conveyed this well.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, I think one thing worth consistently reiterating throughout our time at DBC will be that DBC is not a simple transaction in which we input money and time and the program outputs programming skill. Many of us will likely fall into this trap at one point or another. I think modern education systems (high school, college, etc) can teach us to simply put in the minimal required effort to earn the A, and even in the case of DBC, we can falsely conclude that we're taking a pass/fail course ("failing" being defined as having to repeat a phase twice and thereby being kicked out).
    </p>

    <p>
      However, DBC Pass/Fail is a dangerous idea, because it implies that simply "passing" and finishing the course is the highest possible achievement. Those who take this course as a pass/fail will likely find themselves frustrated at their results by the end of the course.
      </p>

    <p>
      There isn't a convenient solution on how to avoid this mindset. Most of the time, I imagine the only way to overcome DBC Pass/Fail tendencies will be to consistently remind ourselves to keep moving. This lack of clear endpoint is going to be frustrating at first, but I'm convinced it's the only way to avoid simply passing or failing.
