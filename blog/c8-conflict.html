  <p id="title">U3.W8: Conflict</p>

      Prompt: Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      I did some house cleaning a while back, and in the process, I downloaded a lot of music CDs onto my parent's computer, uploaded the songs onto an iPod, and put them into a pile to be thrown out. My dad let the CDs go into the trash, but it was obvious he wasn't pleased.
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      What was the source of the conflict?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was whether to keep the CDs or not. I wanted to throw them out to reduce clutter in the house. He was worried the computer could crash and he'd lose all his music. I had the computer backed up on a hard drive, but it was obvious he still wanted to have the physical copies.

      What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pretty frustrated. I can understand apprehension towards new technology, but MP3s are well enough established by now that I didn't see the point of having CD's randomly dispersed around our home office.

    <p class="display_code">
      What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to explain how the CDs were backed up onto the computer, the iPod, and the hard drive that contained the computer's backups. This helped, but I don't think it entirely resolved the problem. It was obvious he was still pretty bothered.
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      I would've slowed the process down. It's not that my dad's a luddite â€” he's actually pretty comfortable with technology. It's clear that the problem was in the way I presented the situation to him: "This is happening, unless you want to stop it" instead of "Do you want this to happen?"
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      What did you learn from this experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't think my dad would take offense at what I was doing, since I hadn't thrown out his CDs, but I clearly judged it wrong. By placing them in a pile designated for the trash, I was putting the burden on him to keep the CDs out of the trash, which wasn't fair to him.
