      There are a lot of interesting topics we haven't covered in Phase 0, but will be important for your success at DBC and beyond. Select a topic that interests you (or create one) and research it. We don't expect you to be experts in any of these, but try to teach others a high-level understanding of your topic.

      Big O notation is a way of measuring the run-time of an algorithm. Using a limiting rule, one can simplify the comparisons between algorithms as the amount of data they use moves towards infinity. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      f(n) = n**2 + n + 5</br>
      g(n) = n**2
    </p>
    <p>
      For small n, the presence of (n+5) will be significant when comparing f(n) and g(n). However, as n approaches infinity, (n+5) becomes insignificant. This idea leads to the following conclusion:
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      f(n) = O(n**2)</br>
      g(n) = O(n**2)</br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in the comparison of asymptotic run-times, f(n) can be considered as equal to g(n). A good way to think about Big-O notation is to remove everything but the highest-order term. In the example above, lower-order terms n and 5 were removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formal (and therefore more confusing) mathematical definition is as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="display_code">
      f(x) = O(g(x)) iff |f(x)| <= C |g(x)| for all x > N.
    </p>
    <p>
